<h3> Notification of Successful Hire</h3>

<p>A client undertakes to notify JobEasy immediately on agreeing to an engagement with any applicant who has been introduced by the recruitment partner during the preceding 12 months and to pay the recruitment partner an introduction fee due in accordance with clause 2 hereof within 30 days of the receipt of invoice. </p>

<h3>Invoicing</h3>

<p>A client undertakes to notify JobEasy immediately on agreeing to an engagement with any applicant who has been introduced by the recruitment partner during the preceding 12 months and to pay the recruitment partner an introduction fee due in accordance with clause 2 hereof within 30 days of the receipt of invoice. </p>

<h3>Liability</h3>

<p>Applicants introduced to the client are carefully sourced and selected for the relevant vacancies to be filled. The recruitment partner endeavours to take up references but the client should take all necessary steps to obtain confirmation of the applicant’s necessary skills, qualifications, and general integrity.  The ultimate decision to hire an applicant will be the clients. The recruitment partner can accept no liability for any kind of loss or damage to property or for any loss, including without prejudice, to the generality of the foregoing loss of profits, or for any injury to persons arising directly or indirectly from any act or omission of any applicant introduced by the recruitment partner, even if such act or omission is negligent or fraudulent or reveals dishonesty.   </p>


<h3>Statutory Compliance </h3>
<p>
The recruitment partner is committed to compliance with all statutory requirements, specifically the General Data Protection Regulation.  We assert our position as Data Controllers in respect of the candidate data collected by us and shared with our clients.  Data shared with the client is for the purpose of the recruitment process alone and no authorisation is either imputed or inferred regarding the use of the applicant’s personal data beyond that very narrow purpose.   In that respect, we recognise that our clients are also Data Controllers and we act as Joint Controllers.  Both the recruitment partner and the Client warrant to be compliant with GDPR and will keep the other indemnified against any liabilities in respect of any breach of personal data.  Once the applicant is employed by the Client, the recruitment partner ceases to have a joint Controller relationship with the Client in respect of each individual applicant, now an employee of the Client. </p>

<h3>Acceptance</h3>
<p>We deem our terms and conditions to be accepted indefinitely should you engage our services by inviting any of the applicants, introduced by the recruitment partners, for interview. This applies to both a contract of service and for services. 
Any re-negotiations on terms and conditions can only be entertained with 14 days’ notice in writing by the client and will not include any work previously carried out and will only apply to future work carried out after the request has been made.
We look forward to working with you and would like to take this opportunity to wish your organisation continued growth, success, and prosperity with our recruitment advice and the talent that we will source to achieve your company goals. </p>
